What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge is committing all changes and is non-destructive as the history and branches are not changed. A rebase re-writes the history while committing all changes, and relocates our branch to the tip of the main branch.
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository keeps track of versions of your projects and is hosted on servers like the internet or a local network. It is used to share your code with other people.
